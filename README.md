- 👋 Hi, I'm Andrés Andrade (@aaandrades). A Fullstack Software Developer who loves code and create amazing things. I'm Cadastral and Geodesic Engineer with an Specialization in Geographic Information Systems and i've been working in software development for 3 years ago, in frontend and backend roles 🔥.

- 👀 In this moment, i'm interested in the newest technologies in Frontend, Backend and Devops in the cloud world. I've worked with Angular (web and mobile - ionic), React and Android (Native Development), applying REDUX, Observables, Patterns, SASS, CSS, SEO, server-rendering, BEM methodology and more. In the backend, I've worked with NodeJs (Express and Typescript), SpringBoot (Java 8) and a little of Django Rest Framework, managing JsonWebTokens (JWT), security, concurrency and more. In the Database World, with SQL (Mysql and PostgreSQL) and NO-SQL (MongoDB and Redis, just for Cache). Currently i'm learning something about the UI/UX, design in AdobeXD, Illustrator, zeplin and others tools for colaboration. In devops, i've worked with Jenkins and Github Actions (Some repos have a pipeline) in Azure and AWS 🚀.

A teamwork enthusiast who really enjoy help team partners, learn, teach and reach objectives together 👷. I am charismatic, empathetic, supportive and responsible with our tasks (Team tasks and mine).
