- 👋 Hi, I’m @aaandrades, or Andrés Andrade. I'm a fullstack Software Developer who loves code :)

- 👀 I’m interested in the newest technologies in Frontend, Backend and Devops. I've worked with Angular (And Ionic!), React, Flutter, Android (Native Development). Of course, in backend with NodeJs (Express), SpringBoot and a little of Django Rest Framework.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning a bit of Machine Learning, UX/Ui, and all the time I am researching newer technologies to improve my skills in development. In fact, at the moment I am studying Devops technologies. 
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in Full Stack Developer roles where I can add value with excellent code quality and reusability. I am in love with code, and I think creating good code is a somewhat complex but absolutely necessary task.
